I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. My research interests are in efficient inference from language models, hardware acceleration, and probabilistic inference algorithms.

I'm actively involved in various academic and professional associations, including GenLM, ETH AI Center, RycoLab, ETH Analytics Club, and IEEE.

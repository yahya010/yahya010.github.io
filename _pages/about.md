I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. My interests mainly lie in the fields of controlled generation, sampling and decoding methods for language models, and tokenization.

I'm actively involved in various academic and professional associations, including the ETH AI Center, RycoLab, ETH Analytics Club, and IEEE.

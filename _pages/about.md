I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. My research interests are in language model probabilistic programming, and more generally, inference methods with provable guarantees. Additionally, I am interested in building practical, efficient algorithms and serving stacks to make those inference algorithms more usable.

I'm actively involved in various academic and professional associations, including GenLM, ETH AI Center, RycoLab, ETH Analytics Club, and IEEE.

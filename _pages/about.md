I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. My interests mainly lie in the fields of NLP, Psycholinguistics, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Intervention Techniques 
As of right now, I am working on projects that blend cognitive science with Interpretability to understand how to better model human-like Language models and understand the human comprehension process. These include developing cognitively plausible attention mechanisms for language models and implementing constrained decoding methods to improve the grammaticality of generated text.

I'm actively involved in various academic and professional associations, including the ETH AI Center, RycoLab, ETH Analytics Club, and IEEE.
